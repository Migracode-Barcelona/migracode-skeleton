Backend -1st steps

create the databse and execute the script
create the secrets.js file with your local info

cd server
npm install
npm start

front-end 1st steps

cd client
npm install
npm start

if doing npm install you have dependency problems, remove /node_modules and execute npm install again


how to execute front-end and back-end at the same time?
open 2 terminals with visual code, go inside client and server folders and execute both with npm start, check first that you are using different port numbers, you cannot use the same

if the front-end shows a problem related with CORS, install the [CORS Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=es) and activate it
